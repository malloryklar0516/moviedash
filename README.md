# Front End Movie App

## Description
The team has created an app which displayed a currated set of movies, along with trailers, and allows the user to save movies on their must see list. This was done by using OMDB's API, as well as Google's Youtube API.

## User Story

```
AS A user
I WANT to view info on current popular movies, along with their trailers.
SO THAT I can currate my own list of movies to see.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a movie dashboard
WHEN I view a current movie
THEN I am presented with the rating, runtime, and genre for this movie
WHEN I view the info for this current movie
THEN I see a playable movie trailer below it
WHEN I click on the title of the movie
THEN I can see this movie is added to my must see list
WHEN I click on the movie title in my must see list
THEN I notice my screen scroll back to the infomation and trailer for this movie, so I can revisit it
```

## Project Status

This project will be revisited in the near future. The team will update fuctionality so that a User can simply search a movie by title and that movies information and trailer will display. (As opposed to our current currated list)
